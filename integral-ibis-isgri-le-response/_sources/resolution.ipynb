    "* energy resolution for high RT, originally very poor, is improving with time. It is because the resolution is determined primarily by RT measurement uncertainty, and as the bipar line becomes vertical, RT uncertainty becomes irrelevant. \n",
    "* low-RT energy resolution is additionally degraded with time by the \"wiggle\" in the bipar track, associated with electron transport (see plots). \n",
