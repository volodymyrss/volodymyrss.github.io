    "### Multiple Events\n",
    " \n",
    "* When two events trigger in a single ISGRI module, both are **discarded** by MDU and do not appear in ISGRI S1.\n",
    "* When one event triggers in ISGRI and another in PICsIT, both are attributed to `Compton` event class, and **removed from ISGRI S1**.\n",
    "* When event RT is above pre-set threshold, it is **discarded** from ISGRI S1.\n",
    "* if event hits IBIS/VETO, it is discarded\n",
    "* If event is coincident with VETO block counting 511 keV calibration source (inactive since ~2010), it's attributed to ISGRI S2. Even if it does pass RT threshold #TODO: check other condition overlap, what's in S2\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple event rejection allows to substantially suppress background in ISGRI. It was, in fact, one of the major advances of ISGRI comparing to e.g. SIGMA. Many small pixels allow to count much of particle interactions as multiple events, and hence reject them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that on the MDU border, coincidences are possible. Also, suppression is further reduced at the outer detector border, especially in the corners.\n",
    "This creates particular features in background shape, changing with energy as contribution of multiple events changes. (see [](sec:background) for more).\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple events come from:\n",

    "* Compton events\n",

    "* random coincidences (non-negligible because of high ISGRI rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most unusual effects happen due to 22 keV Cd fluorescence line. The line is generated in the pixels themselves, with a short delay following a deposition larger than 22 keV.\n",
    "The 22 keV photon may escape the pixel and interact in the adjustent one. Normally, this results in a double interraction and is removed by ISGRI.\n",
    "However, if the depositoion in the primary pixel is below pixel PH or RT threshold, the event counts as single, since pixel threshold is applied before the MDU effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, any photon above 22 + LT keV might be rejected. This results in suppression of effective area of `XX`.\n",
    "Since LT changes with time, suppression happens from 22 + 14 = 36 keV in early mission, and 22 + 25 = 47 keV in the late mission.\n",
    "Hence region from 36 to 47 keV gains effective area with time.\n",
